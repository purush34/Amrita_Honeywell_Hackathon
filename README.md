### Test Results
#### Dataset 1: Validation accuracy - 100% (using accuracy as a loss function) Test accuracy - 100% (using accuracy as a loss function)
#### Dataset 2: Validation accuracy - 95.42% (using accuracy as a loss function) Test accuracy - 95.692% (using accuracy as a loss function)

### Progress
- [x] Python Keras model as output.
- [x] The module developed shall read through and parse the csv input files.
- [x] Model should be built and evaluated within your python code.
- [x] STM32MX project to be created to evaluate the memory size of the model
- [ ] Ability to detect a combination of conditions - Higher scores
- [x] Model should be adjustable dynamically to changed sampling rate or number of samples
